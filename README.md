# Asteroids
## Essentially a game clone


### How to download, install and use

### 1. Cloning the repo

Let's actually download the game onto your system

```
git clone https://github.com/vilebile17/asteroids_pygame.git
cd asteroids_pygame
```
**Or** you could use github's built in cloner:
```
gh repo clone vilebile17/asteroids_pygame
cd asteroids
```

### 2. Install pygame
The entire game is built using pygame so installing it is pretty important
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
### 3. Make a virtual enviroment
You need to have a virtual enviroment on your terminal in order to run asteroids.

To get one, type into your terminal:

``` 
python3 -m venv venv
```
### 4. Activate the virtual enviroment
Then run
```
source venv/bin/activate
```
You should see (venv) appear to the left of you name in your terminal

**Note:** you will need to reactivate venv every time you close and re-open your terminal
### 5. Finally, to run the game, type

```
python3 main.py
```

### And that's about it!
Have fun and try to see how high you can get your score!
