# Asteroids
## A simple game that we all know
### How to download, install and use

### 1. Cloning the repo

Let's actually download the game onto your system

```
git clone https://github.com/vilebile17/asteroids.git
cd asteroids
```
**Or** you could use github's built in cloner:
```
gh repo clone vilebile17/asteroids
cd asteroids
```

### 2. Make a virtual enviroment
You need to have a virtual enviroment on your terminal in order to run asteroids.

To get one, type into your terminal:

``` 
python3 -m venv venv
```
What this does is it creates a virtual enviroment and assigns it the name "venv".

### 3. Activate the virtual enviroment
Then run
```
source venv/bin/activate
```
You should see (venv) appear to the left of you name in your terminal

**Note:** you will need to reactivate venv every time you close and re-open your terminal if you want to play the game
### 4. Finally, to run the game, type

```
python3 main.py
```

### And that's about it!
Have fun and try to see how high you can get your score!
