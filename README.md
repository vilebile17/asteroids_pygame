# Asteroids
## Essentially a game clone


### How to download, install and use.

### 1. Cloning the repo.

Let's actually download the game onto your system

```
git clone https://github.com/vilebile17/asteroids_pygame.git
cd asteroids_pygame
```
**Or** you could use github's built in cloner:
```
gh repo clone vilebile17/asteroids_pygame
cd asteroids
```

### 2. Playing.
Just simply use `uv` (or similar to run it) 
The `pyproject.toml` file states dependencies and the project manager should automatically install them.
Just run `uv run main.py`

### And that's about it!
Have fun and try to see how high you can get your score!
